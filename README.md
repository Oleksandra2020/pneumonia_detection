# Pneumonia Detection

Project in AI course meant to compare various CNN architectures for pneumonia detection.

## Review of related works

The accuracy of pneumonia detection largely depends on the models that are being used. The most commonly used architectures are pretrained ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 and VGG-16.

There may be different ways to represent detection, too. For example, some models produce a binary result if there is pneumonia on an X-ray image or not, but some can also pinpoint the damaged area. In order to do the latter, in CheXNet research ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05225.pdf)) DenseNet-121 is used as the base model and the last fully connected layer is substituted with a layer with a single output, which produces an F1-score of 0.435. ResNet-152 has also been used in pneumonia localization ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08939.pdf)).

There are also other approaches, which use architectures for feature extraction in combination with a classifier for final pneumonia detection. In the research on pneumonia detection based on feature extraction ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8869364)), where AUC score is used as the main metric, VGG-16 with KNN is also presented, although its score is not the best (0.68). On the other hand, DenseNet-121 with SVM, DenseNet-169 with SVM and ResNet-50 with SVM showed the best AUC scores of around 0.78-0.8.

Although the results are quite good, there are also limitations. In most cases it is not allowed to use patientâ€™s history, so the detection has to be made only through X-ray images. Second, mostly only the frontal X-rays are being used, while having lateral view available, too, improves accuracy of the model.

## Current results

For now pretrained ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 have been used for pneumonia classification based on Chest X-ray images dataset ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)) with around 5 thousand X-ray images present for training. The dataset is imbalanced with 3875 pneumonia images and 1341 normal images. Therefore, weighted loss is used.

The accurracy for ResNet-50 is 62.5% and for DenseNet-121 is 88.6%.
